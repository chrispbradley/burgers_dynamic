Burgers Dynamic
===============

Burgers equation is the simplified version of the Navier-Stokes equation (by dropping the pressure term). This equation can be investigated in one spatial dimension.
The dynamic form of the Burgers equation is implemented in this example.


Building the example
====================

The fortran version of the example can be configured and built with CMake::

  git clone https://github.com/OpenCMISS-Examples/burgers_dynamic.git
  mkdir burgers_dynamic-build
  cd burgers_dynamic-build
  cmake -DOpenCMISSLibs_DIR=~/opencmiss/install/  ../burgers_dynamic/
  make


Running the example
===================

Fortran version::

  cd src/fortran/
  ./burgers_dynamic_fortran

The results can be visualised by running `visualiseBurgersDynamic.cmgui <./src/fortran/visualiseBurgersDynamic.cmgui>`_ with the `Cmgui visualiser <http://physiomeproject.org/software/opencmiss/cmgui/download>`_.
